ECE471 HW5 -- Fall 2018

Name:Ryan Dufour


7.	Describe what your "something cool" code does
	I have included the decoded I2C message using the Analog Discovery 2 analog scope and digital channel functions.
	The captured event is for the "ECE" write.
	The displayed on scope matches up with the hex values I am writing in the C code.
8.
 a). The GPU handles the initial boot on a raspberry Pi. This is actually quite odd, and isn't incredibly common for even non ARM systems.
 b). The boot partition is FAT32 because it is an extremely simple filesystem. When the system is first booted, most peripherals
     are not yet enabled, so having an incredibly complex filesystem to start would not be ideal.
 c). The boot loader is tasked with loading the operating system.
 d). As outlined by the I2C standard, 0x00-0x02 and 0x78-0x7F  are reserved addresses
